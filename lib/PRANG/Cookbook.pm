=head1 NAME

PRANG::Cookbook - Examples of recipes which you can use with PRANG.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The PRANG::Cookbook is a series of recipes showing various PRANG features. Most
recipes are small and self-explanatory but the general layout of each series
shows firstly a simple example with explanations followed by further
enhancements.

Each component of PRANG has a man page describing it, and collectively
these form the PRANG manual.  However, the cookbook is designed to
give quick examples to get up to speed with what you need to know to
effectively use PRANG.

The manual pages for the cookbook do not contain the content; see the
actual source for the examples.
