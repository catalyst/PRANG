=head1 NAME

PRANG::Coerce - Easily create subtypes and coercions for any type

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PRANG::Coerce;

    has_element 'an_array_of_strs' =>
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'PRANG::Coerce::ArrayRefOfStrs',
        coerce => 1,
        ;

    # or

    use PRANG::Coerce;

    PRANG::Coerce::coerce_arrayref_of('Type');

    has_element 'an_array_of_types' =>
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'PRANG::Coerce::ArrayRefOfTypes',
        coerce => 1,
        ;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When defining a type which is an C<ArrayRef[Type]>, sometimes it's nice to be
able to just pass in a C<Type>. By using this module, that C<Type> can be
coerced into the 'ArrayRef[Type]' by using C<ArrayRefOfTypes>.

=head1 PRE-DEFINED TYPES

PRANG::Coerce already defines two array types. These are for C<Str> and C<Int>
and are defined as C<ArrayOfStrs> and C<ArrayOfInts> respectively.
