Description: Moose XML Processor
 PRANG is an XML Graph engine, which provides post-schema
 validation objects (PSVO).
 .
 It is designed for implementing XML languages for which a description
 of the valid sets of XML documents is available - for example, a DTD,
 W3C XML Schema or Relax specification.  With PRANG (and, like
 XML::Toolkit), your class structure is your XML Graph.
 .
 XML namespaces are supported, and the module tries to make many XML
 conventions as convenient as possible in the generated classes.  This
 includes XML data (elements with no attributes and textnode contents),
 and presence elements (empty elements with no attributes which
 indicate something).  It also supports mixed and unprocessed portions
 of the XML, and "pluggable" specifications.
 .
 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
